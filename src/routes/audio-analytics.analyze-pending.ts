// there's no logged-in user session to check here.
//
// Root cause this exists to fix: AmoCRM call sync (syncCallsFromAmo, on its
// own 5-minute cron) reliably populates amocrm_calls.recording_url, but
// nothing ever called Gemini/Whisper on those recordings automatically --
// analyzeCallById only ever ran from the "Tahlil qilish" button a human has
// to click on Audio Analytics, one call at a time. At real call volume,
// virtually nothing ever gets analyzed this way, so lead_quality_stage_id
// (and everything downstream that depends on it -- Lid sifati, the
// Marketing tab, the daily report) stays empty. This job finds calls with a
// recording but no analysis yet and analyzes them in the background.

// stay within typical OpenAI/Gemini per-minute rate limits; a bigger
// backlog just clears over a few more 5-minute ticks instead of one.
