-- Ogohlantirishlar (operational alerts): inactive reps, calls with no
-- recording, low-scored calls, AI-flagged deal-loss risks. The alerts
-- themselves are computed on the fly from amocrm_calls/profiles (there's
-- nothing to backfill and they can never go stale), but "read"/"dismissed"
-- is a real per-admin choice that has to survive a refresh — this table is
-- just that small piece of state, keyed by a stable string the client
-- derives from the alert's type + underlying row (e.g. "no_audio:<call id>").
