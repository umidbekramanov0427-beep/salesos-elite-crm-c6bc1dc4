-- Root cause of "avtomatik sinxronlash faol" showing but nothing ever
-- actually syncing: net.http_post()'s default timeout_milliseconds is
-- 5000 (5s), but syncLeadsFromAmo() paginates through every lead (250 at
-- a time, up to 800 pages) plus contacts/companies/tasks/call
-- notes/users/loss_reasons sequentially against the AmoCRM API -- for an
-- org with several thousand leads this reliably takes well over 5s, so
-- every single cron-triggered call timed out before the sync finished
-- (confirmed via net._http_response.error_msg: "Timeout of 5000 ms
-- reached" on every recent row, status_code always null).
--
-- Fix: reschedule the same job with a 4-minute pg_net timeout instead of
-- the 5s default -- long enough for a full sync, still comfortably under
-- the 5-minute interval between runs so two runs never overlap.
