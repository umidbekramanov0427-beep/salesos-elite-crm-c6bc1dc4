-- CRITICAL: live inspection (pg_policies) confirmed the multi-tenancy RLS
-- retrofit from 20260811060000_multi_tenant_core.sql never actually took
-- effect on this database -- leads_select/deals_select/companies_select/
-- contacts_select were all still literally `using (true)` (i.e. every
-- authenticated user on the whole platform could read every other
-- organization's leads, deals, companies and contacts), and their
-- update/delete policies were missing the organization_id check entirely.
-- profiles_select_authenticated (the old `using (true)` policy) was also
-- still present *alongside* the newer org-scoped profiles_select --
-- Postgres ORs multiple permissive policies together, so its bare `true`
-- silently overrode the correct one, which is exactly what let one
-- organization's admin see another organization's accounts.
--
-- This migration re-issues every policy from that original migration
-- idempotently (drop if exists + create) so the end state is correct
-- regardless of whatever partial state each table was actually left in --
-- covering every table that migration touched, not just the four
-- confirmed broken by direct inspection, since they all came from the
-- same never-fully-applied script.

-- profiles: only the leftover permissive policy needs removing --
-- profiles_select itself (org-scoped) already exists and is correct.
