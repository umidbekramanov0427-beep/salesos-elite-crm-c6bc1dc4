-- The original cron fired /telegram/send-daily-report once at a single
-- fixed time (23:50 Tashkent) for every company, ignoring each org's own
-- "Yuborish vaqti" (send_time) setting entirely -- that field was purely
-- decorative. Reports (Telegram sends, the saved daily_report_history row,
-- and the Google Sheets push) now only actually fire once
-- src/lib/telegram-report.server.ts sees an org's own configured send_time
-- come around, so the cron needs to poll that endpoint often enough for
-- every org's time to be caught, not fire once a day itself.
